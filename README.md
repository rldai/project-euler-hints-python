My solutions for the first 100 ish problems in ProjectEuler.net.

The website asks not to spoil past the first 100 problems, so I will not be doing so (unlike some other repositories). Also, I will not be postiing the numerical answers. You have to at least look at the code instead of just copy and pasting the answer. Please use this if you'd like an ethical, non-spoilery source of ProjectEuler.net solutions. 

All solutions are given an earnest attempt by me, although I admit I had to look up a few solutions (not answers, but solutions). Additionally, solutions were improved after my original solve after looking at the overviews/forum that unlock after solving. This is to ensure I upload the cleanest and most efficient solutions, not just one that works. I will do my best to make it clear what my process was to arrive at the uploaded solution. I am uploading this after about a year of working on ProjectEuler.net problems on and off. This means a lot of my progress, trial and error, etc. has been lost.

Some of these programs import math, but that's it.

In the future, I plan to add all 100 solutions. I also still need to go back and rework solutions and add comments.
