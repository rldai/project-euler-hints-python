High priority:
  First 100 problems in rough numerical order, skipping ones I didn't solve yet.
  Take my solution and compare with Project Euler overview, if it exists
  If not, find most kudosed solutions in the forum and compare with mine
  Have either one "brute force solution" or one "nice solution" 
Medium priority:
  Proofread all code
  Add the other solution (if i started with BF, add the nice one, if i started with the nice one, add the BF one)
  Add runtimes
Low priority:
  Add alternate solutions from forums, websites, other github repos
  Add other languages
