PROBLEM:

<p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with $1$ and $2$, the first $10$ terms will be:
$$1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, \dots$$</p>
<p>By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p>

        How do I get started?
    </summary>
        Look up the Fibonacci sequence. <br>
        What variables you would need to program it? <br>
        Then, what kind of structure should the program should have if it needs to keep generating Fibonacci numbers until they exceed 4 million? <br>

        I don't know the answers.

        The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence defined as F_n-2 + F_n-1 = F_n. <br>
        You need three variables. We can call them x, y, and z. <br>
        Then, we can use a while loop to check if z has exceeded 4 million.

        <code>x = 1
y = 1
z = 2
total = 0
while z < 4000000:
  if z % 2 == 0:
    total += z
  x = y
  y = z
  z = x + y
print(total)</code><br><br>

        But can we make it faster?
    </summary>
        Write down (or look up) the Fibonacci sequence. Are there any patterns you notice?

        I found it! (Rachel's version)
    </summary>
        You probably found that every third Fibonacci number is even. If you're like me, you used this information to write something like this:
    <code>x = 1
y = 1
z = 2
total = 0
i = 0
while z < 4000000:
  if i % 3 == 0:
    total += z
  x = y
  y = z
  z = x + y
  i += 1</code><br><br>
