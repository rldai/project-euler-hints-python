## [The Problem:](https://projecteuler.net/problem=14)

<p>The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>$n \to n/2$ ($n$ is even)</li>
<li>$n \to 3n + 1$ ($n$ is odd)</li></ul>
<p>Using the rule above and starting with $13$, we generate the following sequence:
$$13 \to 40 \to 20 \to 10 \to 5 \to 16 \to 8 \to 4 \to 2 \to 1.$$</p>
<p>It can be seen that this sequence (starting at $13$ and finishing at $1$) contains $10$ terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at $1$.</p>
<p>Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?</p>
<p class="note"><b>NOTE:</b> Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.</p>

        This problem is best dealt with using a recursive function. The <code>chain_length(n)</code> is equal to either <code>1 + chain_length(n / 2)</code> or <code>1 + chain_length(3 * n / 2)</code>. For recursive definition, a starting point must be defined. In this case, <code>if n == 1</code>, then <code>chain_length = 1</code>.
